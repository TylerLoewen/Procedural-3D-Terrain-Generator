# Procedural Terrain Generation using Perlin Noise

Procedural Terrain Generator is a seamless chunk based terrain generator with customizable terrain types. It uses Perlin noise to generate the terrain and implements the Goraud and Flat shading lighting models.

## Getting Started

Download the project and Unity3D. Navigate to "Procedural Terrain Generation > Assets > Scenes" and open one of the scenes to launch Unity3D.

### Prerequisites

Unity3D is needed to modify and recompile the project. Unity can be downloaded [here](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download). Select the Visual Studio Community download in the Unity3D installer to be able to make changes to the code and debug the project.

## Deployment

Each scene can be built into an individual executable.

To do so:

1. Load the scene you want to build
